 * Soft:        The main goal of this project is to provide a fast data-path
 *              for the Linux Kernel XFRM layer. Some NIC vendors offer IPSEC
 *              acceleration via a Crypto mode or a Packet mode. In Packet
 *              mode, all IPSEC ESP operations are done by the hardware to
 *              offload the kernel for crypto and packet handling. To further
 *              increase perfs we implement kernel routing offload via XDP.
 *              A XFRM kernel netlink reflector is dynamically andi
 *              transparently mirroring kernel XFRM policies to the XDP layer
 *              for kernel netstack bypass. fastSwan is an XFRM offload feature.
